# üèÜ Sports League Management System

This project is a **Sports League Management System** designed to efficiently manage and track the details of players, teams, games, venues, leagues, referees, and sponsors in a structured database. The system is modeled using an **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram**, providing a clear representation of the relationships between various entities involved in organizing and managing a sports league.

## Key Features

- **Player Management**: Tracks player details such as name, position, jersey number, date of birth, and team affiliation.
- **Team Management**: Maintains team information, including team name, division, city, and sponsor details.
- **Game Scheduling and Results**: Manages game schedules, venues, scores, and referee assignments.
- **League Participation**: Supports the organization of teams into leagues, including start and end dates and sponsor partnerships.
- **Venue Tracking**: Stores details about venues, including their capacity, location, and hosting details.
- **Sponsor Integration**: Manages sponsor information, including their contact details and sponsorship categories.
- **Statistics Tracking**: Tracks player and team statistics, such as goals, assists, goals for, and goals against.

## Entities and Relationships

- **Player, Team, and League Entities**: Players participate in teams, and teams participate in leagues, with each league associated with specific sponsors.
- **Game and Venue Entities**: Games are hosted in venues, and referees officiate these games.
- **Statistics Entities**: Detailed player and team performance statistics are maintained to support analytics and reporting.

## Use Cases

This system can be used by:

- **Sports organizations** to manage leagues and tournaments.
- **Coaches and teams** to track performance and analyze statistics.
- **Referees** to oversee game scheduling and officiating assignments.
- **Sponsors** to track their involvement and contributions to various leagues and teams.

## Technology and Tools

- **Database:** MySQL for structured and scalable data management.
- **System Design:** ER diagram designed using **draw.io** for clear relationship mapping.
  
## ER Diagram

The **ER diagram**, included in this repository, serves as the blueprint for database implementation, showing the relationships and structure of the system.
